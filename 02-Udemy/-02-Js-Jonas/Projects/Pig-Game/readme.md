####  :confetti_ball: RULES :confetti_ball::

* The game has 2 players, each taking their turn
* Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result is added to its `ROUND` score.
* BUT, if the player rolls the dice and rolls a 1, his `ROUND` score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The player can choose 'Hold', which means that his `ROUND` is added to the `GLOBAL` score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
* The first player to reach 20 points on `GLOBAL` wins the game.
