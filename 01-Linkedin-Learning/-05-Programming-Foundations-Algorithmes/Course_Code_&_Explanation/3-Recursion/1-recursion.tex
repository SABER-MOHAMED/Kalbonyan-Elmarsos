Recursion 
  is when a function call itself

  function f() {
    . . . 
    f()
  }

  Recursive function need to have a breaking condition 
  This prevents infinite loops and eventual crashes 
  each time the function is called, the old arguments are saved 
  This called the "call stack" which is implemented by using stack data structure
