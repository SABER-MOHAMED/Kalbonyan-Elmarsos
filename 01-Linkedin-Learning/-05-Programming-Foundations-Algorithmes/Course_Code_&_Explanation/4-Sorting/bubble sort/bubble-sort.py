stack: 
  collection that support push and pop operations

  stacks are great for programs where you need to reverse things
  Stacks are also good for keeping track of state as things are pushed on and popped off the stacks

  It follow the  LIFO  rule 
  last in first out
  The last item pushed is the first one popped

  if you wanted to add or remove from the bottom of the stack,
  you would have to lift the entire stack in order to add that item. 
  This is why for stacks we add and remove from the top.
