ALgorithm performance
Measure how an algorithm respond to dataset size 
Big-O notation 
    classifies performance as the input size grows 
    "O" indicate the order of operation: time scale to perform an operation 
    It usually describes the worst case scenario of how long it takes to perform a given operation.
Many algorithms and data structures have more than one O 
    iNserting data, searching for data, deleting data, etc.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
| O(1)      | constant time | looking up a single element in array  or define if the number is even or odd
| O(log n)  | logarithmic   | finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search 
| O(n)      | linear time   | searching an unsorted array for a  specific value 
| O(n log n)| Log-Linear    | complex sorting algorithm like heap sort or merge sort 
| O(n^2)    | quadratic     | simple sorting algorithm such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort
