Algorithm 
  a set of instructions that describes how to get the exact result you want

The purpose of an algorithm is 
  to solve a specific problem with a sequential set of steps

Algorithm  characteristics 

* Algorithm complexity 
    space complexity: How much memory does it require ?
    Time complexity: How much time does it take to complete?


* Inputs and outputs 
    what does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?


* Classification
    Serial/parallel
        some algorithms work on their data sets in sequential fashion, which means that they are serial in nature. 
        Whereas a parallel algorithm can break up a data set into smaller pieces and then work on each simultaneously.

    exact/approximate
        An algorithm can be exact, in which case it produces a known predictable value.
        or it can be approximate, in which case, it tries to find an answer that might or might not be exact. 
        For example, a facial recognition algorithm might not give the same answer every single time. 

    deterministic/non-deterministic 
        algorithms can be deterministic, in which case it executes each step with an exact decision.
        or it could be non-deterministic, in which it attempts to produce a solution using successive guesses.
         which become more accurate over time.
