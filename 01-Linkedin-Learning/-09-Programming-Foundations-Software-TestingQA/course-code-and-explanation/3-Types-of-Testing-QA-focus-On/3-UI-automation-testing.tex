UI automation 
    is like manual testing but uses a script to automate test scenarios. 
    The benefit of UI automation is that scenarios can be executed repeatedly by running a test script.
    This will help catch regressions and other oddities much quicker than when done manually
    Another benefit is that the scripts can be run on any platform or browser
