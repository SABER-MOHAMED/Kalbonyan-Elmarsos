Thinking about the program as a box 

Black box testing  
  when the box is completely concealed and it is not possible to see inside of it.

  It allows input to the box and gets output from the box. 

  we don't need knowledge about the internals of the application, 
  such as what the source code is doing or how the system is working.

  focus with black box testing is to perform an action in the user interface
   and expect a certain result from that action.

  Types of black box test 
    manual 
    UI automation 

  QA engineers are responsible for this level of testing.  


Gray box testing 
  Here the box is semi-transparent. 

  Test scenarios here examine the interaction between the outside and inside of the box.

  It requires QA engineers to have a deeper understanding of the application.

  Gray box Tests 
    integration testing
    Trigger some action in the UI 

  QA engineers and developers are responsible for these level of test.


White box testing 
  Here the box is completely transparent 
  the focuses on the internals of the application 
  and what is happening at the code or system level.

  Types of white Box tests
  Unit 
  System 
  Developers are responsible for these type of tests and write them alongside development.

  At the white box level of testing I'm starting from inside the box.
