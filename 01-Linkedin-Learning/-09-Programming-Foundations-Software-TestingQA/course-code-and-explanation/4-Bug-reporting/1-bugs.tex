Bugs 
  are inevitable. They occur when the system does not work as designed or specified,
  and result in incorrect or unexpected behavior in an application.

  Bugs are versatile. 
  They can be low impact or high impact, 
  they can affect many users or just a handful of users, 
  they can be constantly reproducible or not,
  and some bugs even go away and come back later.
