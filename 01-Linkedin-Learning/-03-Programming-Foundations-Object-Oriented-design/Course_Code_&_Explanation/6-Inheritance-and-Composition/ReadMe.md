## objects  
  Identity
    is what you can call an object in the real life  or even more like a bank account can be an object
    object = Noun    ==>  true       the + "Object"   ==> true 
  Attributes
    each object has a special attributes, properties, characteristics, state, fields, variables 
  Behaviors 
    what the object can do 
   

## classes:
  code-template for creating program objects 
  like a cookie cutter  its the way of creating cookies but the cutter it self is not a cookie 
  class always comes first 

### every class has 
  Name or type :
    what is it ?
  Attributes or properties:
    what describe it ?
  Behaviors or operations: 
    what can it do ?


- the function that the objects can do called method 
   method are divided into 
    setter : a method that change the attributes of the object 
    getter : a method that allow you to look at the attributes but not changing them  

the operation of creating an object called instantiation

## Class diagram: 
  a visual representation of the classes in an application
  It contain 
    the name of the class 
    the attributes 
    the methods


## A-P-I-E
- Abstraction:
  Abstraction means we focus on the essential qualities of something rather than one specific example. By using abstraction, we automatically discard what's unimportant or irrelevant.
  Focusing on the idea of a person instead of an individual is an example of what fundamental idea in object-oriented programming?
  just put what the program will need to work 
  We're using abstraction when we define a class



- Encapsulation:
  mean no thing can directly change the data attributes or even know it 
  to protect an object from unwanted changes 
  to have access to the that data you should use methods that object have  
  setter method or getter method that you define 
  black box testing 
  you don't have to know how this method work you can just use them 
  Encapsulate as much is possible

   the purpose of encapsulation
    is to protect an object from unwanted changes

- Inheritance:
  mean making new class from another class 
  the new class will inherit every thing in hte first class 
  and you can add more attributes and methods to the new class
  the first class called the superClass / parent class / base class 
  the new one called the subClass  /  child class / derived class 
  there is no limit to the number of child classes I can create based off of a single parent.
  If you change in a parent it will change in all the child classes 


- Multiple Inheritance:
  mean one child has more than father 
  not good and not supported in all the language 



- polymorphism:
  dynamic polymorphism:
    using overriding
    uses the same interface for methods on different types of objects
    Creating a unique version of an inherited method. 
  static (compile-Time) polymorphism:
    use overloading method
    implements multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters


## object-oriented 
analysis - understand your problem.
answer the question   What do you need to do? 
Design- plan your solution 
answer the question how are you going to do it?
programming- build it  


steps you should follow 

1- Gather requirements 
2- describe the application 
3- Identify the main objects 
4- describe the interaction 
5- create a class diagram
