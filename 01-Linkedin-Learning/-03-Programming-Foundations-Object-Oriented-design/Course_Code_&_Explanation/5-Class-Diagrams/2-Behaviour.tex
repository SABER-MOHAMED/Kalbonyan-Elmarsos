Behavior 
  they're usually named as short verb phrases.

  it's common practice to name methods that modify and retrieve attributes as get instant operations rather than things like change or retrieve.
  And some languages will even automatically generate getter and setter methods for you.

  we'll add parenthesis containing any parameters.

  you could also add a return type by putting a colon after the parenthesis followed by the return type I'm expecting back from the operation.

  You'll commonly see plus and minus signs before the attributes and methods in UML class diagrams. 
  Which is referred to as controlling visibility.
  Minus indicates that a member should be private to the class, meaning it's not directly accessible by other objects.
  plus means the member should be public. 

  The rule here is to leave as many attributes and methods private as possible, and only make something public if you know another object will need to use it.

  Your focus should really be on what object do rather than just viewing them as data structures.
