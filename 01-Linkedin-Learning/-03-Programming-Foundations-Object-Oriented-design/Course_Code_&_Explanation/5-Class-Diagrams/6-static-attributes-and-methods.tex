Instance variable 
  variable for which each instantiated object of a class has separate copy 

Static variable 
  Variable that is shared across all objects in a class
  Also called a shared variable or a class variable 

When it comes to accessing instance level variables, we use the name of the object to get to them.

in addition to static variables, we can also create static methods that exist at the class level. 

Since static methods exist at the class level, they can only access static variables.
