Each class diagram contain 
  Class name 
  Attributes 
  Behaviors

Attributes 
  tart by writing down any obvious ones, and you can always add more later.

  Use whatever naming convention is typical for your programming language. 

  you can also suggest a data type using a colon. So colon String for callSign.
  
  I can also describe a default value, using an equal sign after the data type.
   Not all attributes need that, just where it's relevant and important.
