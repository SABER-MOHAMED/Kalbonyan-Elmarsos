HEAD 
  pointer to tip of current branched in repository 

  Last state of repository, what was last checked out 

  Point to parent of next commit where writing commits takes place 

  The HEAD always points to the tip of the current branch in our repository.

to see where is the head 

you can find the head file in the .git by typing 
ls -la .git 
then 
cat .git/HEAD
then it will tell you where to find this information
cat .git/refs/heads/master 
will give you the sha value of the commit that is the pointer on 

you will not need to actually manipulate the HEAD yourself. Git will take care of that for you.
