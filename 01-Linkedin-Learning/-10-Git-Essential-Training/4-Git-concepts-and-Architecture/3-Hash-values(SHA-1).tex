Hash values (SHA-1)
  The id of each commit 
  Git generate a checksum for each change set
  Checksum algorithms convert data into a simple number 
  same data always equals the same checksum  
  Data integrity is fundamental 
  each hash value is unique 
  changing data would change checksum 

  Git use SHA-1 hash algorithm to create checksums 
  40-character hexadecimal string (0-9, a-f)

  Use meta data in the algorithm
  hat means that you can't change the commit message 
  or the commit author or the parent of the commit 
  without also changing its SHA value.
