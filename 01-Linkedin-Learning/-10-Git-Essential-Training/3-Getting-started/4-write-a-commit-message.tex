how to write a good commit messages
  begin with a short single-line summary (less than 50 character) 

  optionally followed by a blank line and a more complete description 
  Keep each line to less than 72 characters
  write commit message in present tense, not past tense 
    "fix for a bug" or "Fixes a bug" not "fixed a bug" 

    Bullet points are usually asterisks or hyphens
    Can add "tracking numbers" from bugs or support requests
    Can develop shorthand for your organization 
        Ex: 
        you might begin each commit with what kinds of things are being changed
        "[css,js]"
        "bugfix:"
        Or maybe everything begins with one of those bug or support request tracking numbers. 
        "#38405-"


        make sure that your commit messages are clear and descriptive
        Bad: "fix typo" 
        Good: "Add missing hyphen in project section of HTML"

        Bad: "Update login code"
        Good: "Change user authentication to use Blowfish"

        Bad: "Updates member support, we should discuss if this is right next week"
        Good: " "Updates member support"
