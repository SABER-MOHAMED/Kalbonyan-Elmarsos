Distributed version control 
  Different users each maintain their own repositories instead of working from a central repository
  and the changes are stored as sets or patches, and we're focused on tracking changes, not the versions of the documents.
  No central repository
  Changes are stored as changes sets 
    Track changes, not versions
    Different from CVS and SVN, which track versions
    change sets can be exchanged between repositories
    "Merge in changes sets" or "apply patches"

  No single master repository
  Many Working copies

  No need to communicate with a central server 
  Faster 
  No network access required
  No single failure point 

  Encourages participation and forking of projects 
  Developers can work independently  
  Submit changes sets for inclusion or rejection 

  here is no central repository that we all work from. All repositories are considered equal by Git.
