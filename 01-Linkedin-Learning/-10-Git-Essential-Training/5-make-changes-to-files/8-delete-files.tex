when deleting files that in the working area 
  they will just disappear

delete file that is in [staging area]  
  after deleting it normally git will tell you that you deleted a file 

To add this changes to the staging area we use 
  git rm file_name

Now changing is in the staging area and ready to commit 

Now another way of doing that is by using the command directly to delete the file 
  git rm the_file_name 

  Now it goes directly to the staging area
