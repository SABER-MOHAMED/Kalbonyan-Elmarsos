When we created a .gitignore file earlier, git ignored any untracked files 
that matched a rule in the .gitignore file.

However, it only applied those rules to untracked files, files that are already
being tracked are not ignored. 

git rm --cached file.txt
and add it to the git ignore file 
then commit changes
