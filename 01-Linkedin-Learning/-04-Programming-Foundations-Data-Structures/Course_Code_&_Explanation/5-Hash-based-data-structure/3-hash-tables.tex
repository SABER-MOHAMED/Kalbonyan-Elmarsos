A hash table : 
  Is an implementation of the associative array abstract data structure.

Bucket 
  describe each entry or place for a key-value pair to go in a hash table.

Adding Key-Value Pairs 
  Always added as a set 
  Keywords vary by language 
    Put 
    Add 
    Insert

When we add a new pair to the hash table
  The key will go through a hash function and then an integer value will pop out. 
  Its depend on the hash function 

Collision
  Anytime two inputs produce the same hash value (insecure)

Pros: 
  Hash map operation always take hte same amount of time, regardless of the size of the hash table 
  Search O(1)
  Insertion O(1)
  Deletion O(1) 
  Hash tables are excellent at managing many key-value pairs and volatile data.
