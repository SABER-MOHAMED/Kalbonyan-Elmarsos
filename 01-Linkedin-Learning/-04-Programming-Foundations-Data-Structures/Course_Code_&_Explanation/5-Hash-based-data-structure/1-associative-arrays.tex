Hash tables or dictionaries:
  associative arrays:
    collection of Key-value pairs 
    Key:Value

  Advantages:
    every item have a key. 
    a key that allows us to access our data in a meaningful way.
    Key-value pair are bound together.
    key-to-value mapping are unique.
    value do not accessed with the key.
    Keys are mapped to data values by using a hash to compute an index value.
    hash tables are typically are usually more efficient.
    Order Isn't important.
    

  Cons: 
    for small datasets, arrays are usually more efficient
    hash tables don't order entries in predictable way
