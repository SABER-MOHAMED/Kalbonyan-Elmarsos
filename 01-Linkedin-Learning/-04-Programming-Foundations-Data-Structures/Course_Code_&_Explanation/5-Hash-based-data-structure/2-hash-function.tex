Hashing 
  is a way of taking some raw data and mixing it together to form a smaller single piece of data.

Hash Inputs 
  Characters 
  Objects 
  Numbers 

output 
  would be an integer. 


The hash function is one way (are not reversible)

Hashing is used for security measure 

How hash function work 
  Password: twentyTwoEver

  A very simple hash function might take the decimal ASCII value of each character and sum them up to produce an integer.

ASCII:
  Numerical representation of text characters 
  EX:
    T = 116 
    W= 119 
  this is very simplistic and most hash functions are more complicated.

Collision
  Anytime two inputs produce the same hash value (insecure)

However, with the hash function, the same input will always produce the same output.
Meaning that a single password or input will only have one hash value.
