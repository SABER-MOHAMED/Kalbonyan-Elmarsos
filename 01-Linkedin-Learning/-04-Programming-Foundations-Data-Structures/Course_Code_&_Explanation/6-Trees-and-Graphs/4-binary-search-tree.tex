- A binary tree is 
  a specialized type of tree. 
  It adds the constraint that each node has two immediate child nodes.
  We call the child nodes left and right nodes respectively.

A binary search tree (BST)
  we keep track of order and keep a sorted data structure by being particular about what values are in the left child, right child, and parent nodes.

  the rules
    A left child node must be less than its parent 
    a right child node must be more than its parent.

  That making the search more easy
