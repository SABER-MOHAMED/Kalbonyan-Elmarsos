Set: 
  A collection of unique items 
  Order doesn't matter
  None of the elements are duplicated
  we don't have index or index 

Why use sets ?
  sets are a way of grouping things with a common property. 

Membership
  With sets, we are usually testing if a piece of data is a member in that set.

Implementation 
  sets are actually using the same idea of hash tables most of the time. 
  Instead of hashing a key to store a separate value object, when you're using a set, the key is the value. 
  We don't have two pieces of information, we're just adding one. 
  So a set works by taking an object, hashing it, and then using the generated index to store the object itself. 
  Then, to check membership, to find out if we already know about a particular object, we just repeat the process and see if this object is already stored.
  We only care about membership, if the object is already in the set.
  In checking to see if an object is in the set, we already need to have the object itself,which is why we never use sets for retrieval of data.
