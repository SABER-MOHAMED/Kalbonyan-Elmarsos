A tree data structure 
  Like a linked list, a tree data structure contains nodes but it's really a collection of nodes. 
  The main difference is that the nodes in the tree might be linked to one, two or more nodes.

  Like a linked list, a tree data structure contains nodes but it's really a collection of nodes. 
  The main difference is that the nodes in the tree might be linked to one, two or more nodes.  

  he root is the parent of both of these child nodes and the root itself has no parent.

  child nodes with the same parent are siblings 

  Each node can have 
    Many children 
    Just one child 
    No children 

Pros: 
  If your data has an order and you will be inserting, deleting, searching and accessing items a lot, then binary search trees are great. 

  Balanced tree:
    O(Log(n))
  Unbalanced tree: 
    O(n)

  require some overhead and maintenance
