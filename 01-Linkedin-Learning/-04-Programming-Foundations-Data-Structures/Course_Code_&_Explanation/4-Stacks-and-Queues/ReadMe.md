After defining requirements and writing some use cases or user stories we start to transition from analysis,
understanding the problem we're trying to solve, to design, how we're going to organize our solution.

with the analysis done, our next step is to create a conceptual model.

### conceptual model

Represent important objects and the relationships between them.

To identify objects
we'll go through all of our use cases and user stories and any other written requirements
to pick out all of the nouns.
after defining the objects we simply drawing a box around each of those objects we have the beginning of a conceptual model.

---

- Once we have the potential objects picked out for our conceptional model, it's useful to indicate the main relationships or associations between those concepts by drawing lines between the boxes.
  Now, optionally, it may be useful to add a short note to actually describe the relationship.

  The benefit of detailing these relationships is that it makes it easier to realize which objects interact with each other,
  meaning which objects have behaviors that affect other objects.

---

- We need to figure out the responsibilities for our conceptual objects to really identify what are, and what are not classes that we'll need to create.
  We will go back to the user stories and look for verbs, and verb phrases to identify responsibilities.

Where these responsibilities belong ? Particularly if they affect different objects.

When asking the question of where should a behavior live, or whose responsibility is it?
Remember that an object should be responsible for itself.

  Class
  Responsibility
  Collaboration

They're drawn on index cards, and they're meant to be simple.

Each CRC cards represents one class
it has three sections. The first section is the name of the class at the top, which is usually underlined.

The Right section is the Responsibilities of the class, the things that it needs to take care of.

The left section is for the Collaborators, the other classes it interacts with.

CRC cards typically use this format with the responsibilities taking up the left two-thirds of the card, and the collaborators on what's remaining to the right.
