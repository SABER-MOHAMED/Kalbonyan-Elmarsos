  double-ended queue
    double-ended queue is like having a stack and a queue at the same time. 
    have a collection of items and we can add new items to this, 
    but we can choose to add and remove from either end. 
    restriction is we can't remove from anywhere else in the collection.

    EX:
      q = queue.Queue()
      q.empty()# if the queue is empty or not 
      q.put("item1")# putting items in the queue 
      q.put("item2")
      q.put("item3")

      q.get()# give you the item1 
      q.get()# give you the item2
      q.get()

    EX: 
      queue = deque()

      # add some items to the queue
      queue.append(1)
      queue.append(2)
      queue.append(3)
      queue.append(4)

      # print the queue contents
      print(queue)

      # pop an item off the front of the queue
      x = queue.popleft()
      print(x)
      print(queue)
