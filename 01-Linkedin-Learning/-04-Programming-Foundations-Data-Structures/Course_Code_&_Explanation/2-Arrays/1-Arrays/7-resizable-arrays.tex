Some languages let you resize basic arrays and others do not.
  Ex: 
  java and C++
    Basic arrays cannot be resized 
    meaning if you made it of seven slots then you cannot add or remove any slot 
    BUT you can change the value of each slot as you want

  EX:
  Ruby and javascript
    basic arrays can be resized by adding or removing items
