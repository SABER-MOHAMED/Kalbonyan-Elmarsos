jagged array: 
  like multi dimensional array but 
  each inner array can have different number of elements

  this means that if we're iterating through the array
  we'll need to access the length of each individual array because their sizes can be different.   

  EX: 

  jagged_array = [
    [1, 3, 8]
    [1, 2]
    [9, 0]
    [10, 11, 4, 20, 50]
    [30]
  ]

  Notice that 
    some language consider multidimensional arrays and jagged_array the same like python
