array is:
  a collection of elements, where each item is identified by an index or key
  data structure is a collection with defined way of accessing and sorting items
  
  every element in the array have an unique index 
  the index start from 0 

  EX:  (java)
    int[] lotteryNumbers = {0, 2, 18, 40, 14, 30};
    int first = lotteryNumbers[0]

  EX:  (python)
    lotteryNumbers = [0, 2, 18, 40, 14, 30]
    second = lotteryNumbers[1]

  Notice that 
    although this kind of data structure known as lists in python 
    But it's Basically an array

There is an error called: index out of bounds that occur when:
  program is trying to access an item at a position that is outside the array's limit.
