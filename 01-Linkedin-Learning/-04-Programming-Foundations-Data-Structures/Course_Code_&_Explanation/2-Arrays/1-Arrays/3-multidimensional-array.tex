multidimensional arrays 
  2d array is an array and every element in the array is an array itself 
  The rule is that every inner array must have the same number of elements
  
  EX:   (python)

    the_2D_array = [
        [1, 2, 3]
        [4, 5, 6]
        [7, 8, 9]
    ]
  that is how  we access an element in 2d array
    print(the_2D_list[0][2])
    the result will be 3
