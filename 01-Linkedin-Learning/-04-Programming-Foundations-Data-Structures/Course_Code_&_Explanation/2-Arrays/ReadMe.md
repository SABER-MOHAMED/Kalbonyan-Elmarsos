# Gather the requirements

The first step to any design process is to gather your requirements.
Figure out what your application or product needs to do.

requirements = what does the program need to do ?
what is the problem you are trying to solve ?
why are you building the program in the first place?

### functional requirements:

what must it do?
the application must do ......

### non-functional requirements:

how should it do it ?
the system should be ....
Legal
performance
Support
security

many developers fall into is having a dozen semi formed ideas about the cool features their app could have, versus nailing down what it really needs to do.

be specific, and write things down.

## FURPS

One commonly used model for classifying software quality attributes
FURPS serves as a checklist of several key qualities to consider when determining requirements.

FURPS refer to

- functionality: Functionality refers to the capabilities and features of the app.
  capability, reusability, security

- useability: affects the person who will be using the program.
  Is it easy on the eyes?
  Is it intuitive to use?
  Is the documentation accurate and complete?
  Human factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation

- Reliability:
  Is it easy on the eyes? Is it intuitive to use?
  Is the documentation accurate and complete?

  availability, failure rate & duration, predictability

- performance:
  dictate the application's response time through put.
  And they put limits on the system resources it can use. In supportability.

  speed, efficiency, resource consumption, scalability

- supportability:

  Make sure the application can be tested, extended, serviced and installed and configured.

  testability, extensibility, serviceability, configurability

### FURPS+ add more four categories

- Design:
  addresses constraints on how the software must be built because the app requires certain things such as a relational database.

- Implementation:
  Does it have to be written in a certain language?
  Are there standards or methodologies that need to be followed?

- Interface:
  refer to an external system that needs to be interfaced with.

- Physical requirements:
  Actual physical constraints related to the hardware the application will be deployed on.
