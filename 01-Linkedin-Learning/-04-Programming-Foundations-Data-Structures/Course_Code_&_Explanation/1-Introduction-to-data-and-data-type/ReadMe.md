### Data:

Is information that is sorted ot processed by a computer
Ex:
your birthday
the name of city

### Data types:

an attribute of data that describes the values it can have and how the data can be used
Ex:
Numbers
Letters
true(1)
false(0)
We classify different pieces of data with data types based on their value.

### numerical data types (in java)

    * whole numbers                                 take size
      short       -32,768 to 32,767                  16 bit    for every short whatever it is
      int         -2 billion to 2 billion            32 bit    for every int whatever it is
      long        -(2^63)  to (2^63)                 64 bit    for every long whatever it is

    * decimal numbers
      float      7 decimal digits                     32 bit
      double     16 decimal digits                    64 bit

    signed and unsigned data

      signed data type
        can store the positive and negative numbers

      unsigned data type
        can store only the positive

    * byte is 8 bit
      each byte can represent a letter

### Notice that:

some language like Javascript have one numerical datatype which is number

---

### boolean data type

    boolean is either true or false
    1   or   0
     it takes one bit

    Ex:   (In C#)
      bool isLightOn = false;

    Ex:   (In python)
      isLightOn = true;

### character data type

    char mean one letter or symbol
    take 8 bit or 16 in other language

    Ex:  (C++)
      char firstInitial = 'K';
      Take (8 bits)

    Ex:   (Kotlin)
      val firstInitial: char = 'K';
            Take (16 bits)

---

### Primitive data types:

are types that have a fixed size that do not depend on the data inside of them.
EX:
Int
double
long
float
short
boolean
char

---

### data structure

is a collection with defined way of accessing and sorting items
is referenced data types.
Data structures are made up of pieces of data such as int or char.
have a specialized way and format of organizing and storing these pieces.
Data structures give us organization, storage, and access.

### what exact size of data structure depends

allocated space for structure
Number of piece of data
size of each data piece

---

### string

is a Referenced data type
Is a data type composed of a sequence of characters.
It's a data type that's built out of another data type.
its implemented with a data structure

EX: (javascript)
var name = "jessica"

EX: (python)
name = "jessica"
