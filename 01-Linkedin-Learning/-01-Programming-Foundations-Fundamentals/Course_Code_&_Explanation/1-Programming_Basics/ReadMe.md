### why we have a lot of programming language?

The main reason why we have so many languages is that each comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.

### writing the source code

- can be in a text editor like notePad
- must be in plain text
- mean NO format

### Running your source code

there is three kind of programming language

- compiled language: C, C++, Objective-C
  they take your high level programming language and turn it into an executable that contains low level machine code. this way, users can run your code on their machine without every needing your original source

- interpreted language: PHP, Javascript
  they process your source code each times its run, line by line, and it's up to the other user to have the needed interpreter available on their machine

- Combination: Python

### I-D-E

- Integrated development Environment
  help you write code by great extension, autocompletion(IntelliSense), syntax-highlighting

- ex:
  Atom, VS code, X-code, ByCharm
